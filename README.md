# Tic Tac Toe 
This applications allow the user to play a game of tic tac toe against themselves. I wanted to give the game a retro 80's inspired vapor-wave aesthetic, and make sure that the player turn and game results are displayed clearly. I wanted the game status to include both who's turn it is as well as the results of the game for a more seamless layout. I hope you enjoy my first in-class project ðŸ˜Š.
